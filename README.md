# ProjectManagement
Title - Project Management Form

Description -
This project uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and JPDB. It takes input from user using HTML forms and saves it in JPDB. The user can insert new records, update existing records and delete existing records from the database using UI.
The project contains a simple form that contains input fields and buttons. When user enters project id, if the record already exists then it displays values in all other fields so the user can update or remove the record. If record not present then user has to fill all the fields and click on save then the record is inserted.

Benefits of using JSONPowerDB -
- JSONPowerDB is a pure JSON, real-time, scalable database.
- It has built-in indexes which makes the retrieval faster and cost-effective.
- Since it is JSON based, it can store huge amount of unstructured data and indexing helps us retrieve it faster.
- It has GeoSpatial API which gives us trends and patterns based on geographics regions. This is especially very useful for applications using data analytics, recommendation systems etc.
- It provides RDBMS APIs as well as Key-value store database APIs.
- It is a real-time dabase that also allows us to query multiple databses at once along with multiple security layers.
- It provides a developer-friendly user interface.
- We can import data of CSV and JSON format and we can also have data in various forms like text, binary, media etc.
- It is a DaaS i.e. Database as a Service.
- It can work as an independent server or as a shared environment.
